# ZebraAI-Escalation-Case-Assistant
ðŸ¤– 2. Zebra AI â€“ Escalation Case Assistant
Industry: AI/ML Automation for Support Engineering

ðŸ§  Project Story
Working closely with technical support teams, I noticed how much time is spent manually digging through tickets, especially escalated ones.
Zebra AI was born out of that frustration â€” a GenAI assistant that retrieves and summarizes the real-time status of critical cases in seconds.
The vision is to empower support engineers with faster context, reduce dependency on multiple tools, and enable data-driven decisions during escalations.

âœ… Features
One-click status retrieval from case ID

Summarizes customer pain points + current engineering status

Prompts for internal escalation review and RCA generation

Designed as a Copilot-style plugin for internal use

ðŸ›  Tech Stack
Python, Azure OpenAI, Kusto (KQL)

Internal API calls for case tracking

Prompt library for RCA/summary templates

ðŸ“ˆ Outcomes
Reduced manual case follow-up time by 80%

Designed for future integration with Copilot & Teams
